You can see the detailed dry-run output at /home/zudarr/.vscode-server/data/User/workspaceStorage/c6897ba85ac3f4872df5a0b36f5c22c7/ms-vscode.makefile-tools/dryrun.log
Make sure that the extension is invoking the same make command as in your development prompt environment.
You may need to define or tweak a custom makefile configuration in settings via 'makefile.configurations' like described here: [link]
Also make sure your code base does not have any known issues with the dry-run switches used by this extension (makefile.dryrunSwitches).
If you are not able to fix the dry-run, open a GitHub issue in Makefile Tools repo: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-makefile-tools/issues
